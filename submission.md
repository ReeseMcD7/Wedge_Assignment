# Applied Data Analytics

## Wedge Project



### Task 1

* Files for this task: 

Wedge_Data_Eng_Task1.ipynb:

This notebook unzips, formats, and cleans the Wedge transaction data files and then uploads them to Google BigQuery.

### Task 2

* Files for this task: 

Wedge_Data_Eng_Task2.ipynb:

This notebook uses the cleaned and uploaded data to generate a sample of owners and their transactions and writes it to csv within the main directory.

### Task 3

* Files for this task: 

Wedge_Data_Eng_Task3.ipynb:

This notebook queries the uploaded data to gather a collection of summary tables and uses them to build a db. database file. 


## Query Comparison Results

Fill in the following table with the results from the 
queries contained in `gbq_assessment_query.sql`. You only
need to fill in relative difference on the rows where it applies. 
When calculating relative difference, use the formula 
` (your_results - john_results)/john_results)`. 



|  Query  |  Your Results  |  John's Results | Difference | Rel. Diff | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total Rows  |   |   |   |   |
| January 2012 Rows  |   |   |   |   |
| October 2012 Rows  |   |   |   |   |
| Month with Fewest  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA  |
| Num Rows in Month with Fewest  |   |   |   |   |
| Month with Most  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA  |
| Num Rows in Month with Most  |   |   |   |   |
| Null_TS  |   |   |   |   |
| Null_DT  |   |   |   |   |
| Null_Local  |   |   |   |   |
| Null_CN  |   |   |   |   |
| Num 5 on High Volume Cards  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA  |
|  Num Rows for Number 5 |   |   |   |   |
| Num Rows for 18736  |   |   |   |   |
| Product with Most Rows  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA  |
| Num Rows for that Product  |   |   |   |   |
| Product with Fourth-Most Rows  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA  |
| Num Rows for that Product  |   |   |   |   |
| Num Single Record Products  |   |   |   |   |
| Year with Highest Portion of Owner Rows  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA |
| Fraction of Rows from Owners in that Year  |   |   |   |   |
| Year with Lowest Portion of Owner Rows  |   |   | Yes/No  | NA |
| Fraction of Rows from Owners in that Year  |   |   |   |   |

## Reflections

<!-- I'd love to get 100-200 words on your experience doing the Wedge Project --> 
What a challenge this project was! Getting through the code was an adventure, but the satisfaction of finally building all this python code that works exactly as it should was a uniquely satisfying moment (especially with no prior experience with the language). This project made me confident that my personality is configured correctly for this kind of work.
