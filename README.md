# Wedge_Assignment

## Feedback

The differences in the submission file are odd to me, particularly the month with the fewest rows. If we had infinite time and resources it'd be fun to get to the bottom of them. 

### Task 1

* One note generally. You have a lot of typos in things like comments and written responses on this project. Not a hudge deal, but remember to do some proofreading on future work, particularly stuff that you'd going to use as part of a professional portfolio. (The thing that prompted this precise comment is your error message of `Cannot delete the folder as it doesn't exists`.) 
* Try avoiding names like `keys` and `values` and go for stuff that's more descriptive. 
* I think you should _either_ escape your backslashes (`"my\\file\\path"`) or use raw strings (`r"my\file\path"`, but not do both.
* There seem to be places where you could make this a bit more efficient, but it gets the job done.

Nice work overall. This task is hard, but you got it done. 

### Task 2

* Very clever CTE use to extract the records. This is maybe the most elegant approach I've seen, including my own. 
* The only advantage to doing the random selection in python is setting the seed so you can get reproducible results. 

Otherwise, very smooth. 

### Task 3

Excellent work on this, no real notes. I'd consider just going straight into the SQL DB with `to_sql`, but what you have works great.
